Client Credentials Flow authentication for SAFE back-end
======= 

This readme details the process to authenticate to SAFE back-end using the client credentials flow. This flow is used for giving access to SAFE API to a user as an application and not as an individual. In this way permissions will be linked to the client application and every user of this application will share the same permissions.
